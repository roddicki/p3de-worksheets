[Install-Unity-6000.1.9f1.pdf](Install-Unity-6000.1.9f1.pdf)   

The install is over 10gb (depending on platform) and we are only using the following versions.

## Unity 6000.1.9f1

it is important to install this Mac / Pc version and no other version.   
Often Unity projects are not very compatible between versions so it is important to install this Mac / Pc version and no other version.   
We may not be able to mark your work if it is made with a different version of Unity.

You may have to select the 'silicon' version if you are using a Mac with an M1/M2/M3 chip (this is in most Macs from 2021 onwards)
